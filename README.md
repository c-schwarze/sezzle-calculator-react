# Sezzle Calculator using React.js

Currently, this is using React.js. I plan on setting this up  with GoLang for the backend language. I also plan to hook it up to a MySQL DB, possibly using an ORM to interface with it. Then I can add a handful of interesting features - comments, timestamps, users, etc.

## Start application

To start the project in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
